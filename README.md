# ☕ Daily Brew Coffee — Business Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
Daily Brew Coffee Ltd. is a growing coffee chain operating across multiple retail locations in New York City.  
The business collects large volumes of data but lacks clarity on performance, trends, and decision-making insights.

This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into **clear business insights and actionable recommendations** using Power BI.

Rather than focusing only on visuals, this project follows a structured analytics framework:

> **📊 Dashboard → 🔍 Insight → 🎯 Recommendation**

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
The dashboard was designed to help stakeholders answer key business questions:

- How is the business performing over time?
- Which stores and products drive the most revenue?
- What are the sales and profitability trends?
- Who are our customers from a demographic perspective?
- Where are the risks, opportunities, and improvement areas?

---

## 🧩 Dataset Overview
The analysis is based on multiple relational tables, including:

- **Sales / Food Inventory** – Transaction-level sales data  
- **Products** – Product details, pricing, and cost  
- **Stores** – Store type, location, and size  
- **Customers** – Customer demographics and tenure  
- **Calendar** – Date, month, quarter, and year attributes  
- **Employees** – Staff master data (not directly linked to sales)

All tables were modeled using a **star schema** approach for optimal performance and clarity.

## ⚠️ Data Limitations & Assumptions
Some business questions could not be fully answered due to data constraints:

- **Customer-wise revenue** is limited due to missing transaction-to-customer linkage.
- **True average basket size** is unavailable without receipt-level item grouping.
- **Time-of-day sales analysis** is not possible due to missing hour/minute data.
- **Employee-level sales performance** cannot be calculated without staff-to-transaction mapping.

These limitations are explicitly documented to maintain analytical transparency.
